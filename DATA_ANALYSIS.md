# Enhanced BigQuery Data Analysis and Agent Instructions

## 1. CURRENT DATA ANALYSIS

### Current BigQuery Tables and Data Assessment

Based on the existing schema in `DEPLOYMENT_LOCAL.md`, we have:

**‚úÖ ADEQUATE TABLES:**
- `advisors` (3 advisors)
- `clients` (5 clients) 
- `accounts` (6 accounts)
- `holdings` (8 holdings across asset classes)
- `transactions` (6 recent transactions)
- `todo_tasks` (8 prioritized tasks)

### Data Quality Assessment for New UI Requirements

**‚úÖ SUFFICIENT FOR BASIC FUNCTIONALITY:**
- Current data supports all 8 widgets
- Relationships between tables are properly established
- Sufficient variety for realistic testing

**‚ùå NEEDS ENHANCEMENT FOR PRODUCTION:**
1. **More diverse client data** - Need client tiers, contact dates, risk profiles
2. **Holdings need more details** - Symbols, quantities, sector information
3. **Historical data** - Performance tracking, trend analysis
4. **Calendar integration data** - Meeting history, upcoming appointments
5. **Message history** - Communication tracking
6. **NBA data** - Client interaction patterns, opportunity scoring

## 2. ENHANCED DATA SCHEMA (RECOMMENDED)

### Additional Columns for Existing Tables

```sql
-- Enhance clients table
ALTER TABLE `apialchemists-1-47b9.apialchemists.clients` 
ADD COLUMN tier STRING,
ADD COLUMN last_contact_date DATE,
ADD COLUMN risk_profile STRING,
ADD COLUMN total_portfolio_value NUMERIC;

-- Enhance holdings table  
ALTER TABLE `apialchemists-1-47b9.apialchemists.holdings`
ADD COLUMN symbol STRING,
ADD COLUMN quantity NUMERIC,
ADD COLUMN sector STRING,
ADD COLUMN current_price NUMERIC;

-- Create additional tables
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `apialchemists-1-47b9.apialchemists.meetings` (
  meeting_id STRING,
  client_id STRING,
  advisor_id STRING,
  meeting_date DATETIME,
  meeting_type STRING,
  notes TEXT
);

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `apialchemists-1-47b9.apialchemists.communications` (
  comm_id STRING,
  client_id STRING,
  advisor_id STRING,
  comm_type STRING,
  comm_date DATETIME,
  subject STRING,
  content TEXT
);

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `apialchemists-1-47b9.apialchemists.opportunities` (
  opportunity_id STRING,
  client_id STRING,
  opportunity_type STRING,
  potential_value NUMERIC,
  confidence_score NUMERIC,
  created_date DATE
);
```

2. **‚úÖ Chat agent instructions are IMPLEMENTED** in main.py
3. **üìã OPTIONAL ENHANCEMENTS** for production:
   - Add enhanced data schema above
   - Implement dedicated prompt templates file
   - Add conversation memory/context
   - Integrate with Google Calendar API for real meeting data

### READY TO DEPLOY:
- Current BigQuery data supports all 8 widgets
- Chat agent has comprehensive knowledge base
- All endpoints are functional with fallback data

The system is ready for deployment with current data structure. Enhanced schema can be added iteratively based on user feedback.
